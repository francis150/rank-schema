            {
                "question": "How much is it to repair a roof?",
                "answer": "Most home owners spend between $300 and $1,100 for a roof repair, or an average of $650 per repair call. Typically, a job is to repair leaks. Seal the leak, replace shingles, seal the shingles. If there is a small area and few shingles being repaired, it will likely be on the low end, or as little as $150."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do you repair a damaged roof?",
                "answer": "Replacing Roof Shingles. Slip a flat pry bar under the damaged shingle and press down to pop out the roofing nails. Fix Curled Roof Shingle Corners with Caulking. Slide the new shingle up into place. Cracked Roof Shingles Repair. Carefully lift the upper shingle and secure the new shingle with roofing nails."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can a handyman repair a roof?",
                "answer": "To start things off, a handyman can definitely handle small repairs on your roof. They don’t need any fancy tools, and there’s a good chance they already have everything at their disposal. The next time your handyman comes over for a project, ask him or her whether they can take a look at your roof."
            },
            {
                "question": "How do you seal a leaking roof?",
                "answer": "To repair leaks caused by metal flashing around chimneys and dormers, simply reseal joints using a caulk gun filled with roofing cement. If you see damage to joints previously sealed with a line of roof cement, apply a fresh new coat with a putty knife."
            },
            {
                "question": "Does homeowners insurance cover roof repair?",
                "answer": "Homeowners insurance may cover a roof leak if it is caused by a covered peril. Suppose your roof is damaged by fire, hail or wind. However, homeowners insurance generally does not cover damage resulting from lack of maintenance or wear and tear. Instead, it typically helps pay to repair sudden, accidental damage."
